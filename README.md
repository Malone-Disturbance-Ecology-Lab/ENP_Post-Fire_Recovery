# Fire is Essential for Enhanced Productivity in Fire-Adapted Ecosystems


Fire plays a key role in the health of fire-adapted ecosystems. But in areas where natural fire patterns are disrupted, it’s hard to know how ecosystems will respond to fire. Our research shows that regular fire is essential for Everglades pineland resilience. Contemporary productivity, measured by NDVI, was closely linked to fire history. Interestingly, how the land was doing before a fire—its pre-fire NDVI—was the strongest determinant of how quickly ecosystems recovered from fire, whether it occurred as a prescribed or wild fire. Regular fires enhance productivity and promote rapid post-fire recovery.

### Scripts are ordered by major workflow steps:
1 = Data Preparation and Integration (fire perimeter files, Ladsat data, vegetation layers)
2 = Baseline NDVI Evaluation Workflow (Develop the dataframe used for the baseline NDVI model and make the model)
3 = Recovery Dataset Development (Develop the dataframe used for the driver analysis)
4 = Analysis Workflow (Driver Analysis for the recovery dataframes)
5 = Data vizualization
